  <h3>Lacrosse Lessons</h3>
  <p>The sport of lacrosse has created so many opportunities and I was fortunate enough to play for 4 years at Princeton University.  I wanted to build an app to help youth and inexperienced players gain access to private lessons from some of the best lacrosse players in the country.</p>

  <h3>NYC Farmers' Markets</h3>
  <p>This project utilizes a D3 (Data-Driven Documents) map that shows the locations of farmers' markets in the New York City area in 2013.  We implemented a jQuery UI slider to display circles on the map indicating farmers' markets that are open for service on that particular day.</p>
